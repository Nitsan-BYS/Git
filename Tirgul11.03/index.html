          <p><b><i>Earth</i></b> is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.<br> About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of
              continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also by lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere.
              <br>Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years.<br>Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core,
              a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.
